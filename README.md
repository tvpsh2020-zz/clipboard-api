Sample for Clipboard API and events in web applications (without asynchronous Clipboard API), you can try to paste image file from system's clipboard, either files or screenshot.

When trying to paste image, it works on macOS with Chrome, but Windows with Chrome can only paste the screenshot in clipboard. Pasting text is fine on both macOS and Windows.
